## Nintendo 3DS eBook Reader
[Download](https://github.com/reworks/3DS_eBook_Reader/releases/latest "Download the latest release here.")

### Instructions:
Place books in a folder named "books" on the *root* of your SD card. Some books can take a while to load! Be patient!

Make sure your ebooks are in .epub 3 or later format. You can use tools like [sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/) or [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

I recommend going to DRM-Free bookshops or public domain websites such as [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
The reason I recommend this is because this app DOES NOT SUPPORT BOOKS WITH DRM.


IF THE FORMAT IS WRONG, THE APP WILL FREEZE/CRASH.

THIS APP IS ONLY TESTED WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE BOOKS.
