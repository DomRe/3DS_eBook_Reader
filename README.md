## Instructions:
Place books in a folder named "books" on the *root* of your SD card. Some books can take a while to load! Be patient!

Use calibre (google it) to convert other formats to .epub. Make sure its as strict as possible when converting.

MUST BE IN A VALID AND COMPLIANT .EPUB FORMAT. DRM-FREE EBOOK SHOPS ARE YOUR BEST BET.

IF THE FORMAT IS WRONG, THE APP WILL FREEZE/CRASH.

## Building
You must first install devkitPro, libctru, sf2d, sftd, sfil and the portlibs. To get the zip on windows you will also need gnu32 zip + unzip binaries.

Then run "build-cia.bat" or "build-cia.sh" depending on your platform.
